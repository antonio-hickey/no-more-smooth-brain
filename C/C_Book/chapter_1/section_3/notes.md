Chapter 1 Section 3: The For Statement
===

Basically just showing how to write the program from the [last section](https://github.com/antonio-hickey/no-more-smooth-brain/blob/master/C/C_Book/chapter_1/section_2/temp_conversion.c) with a for loop instead of a while loop. 

Not much to learn here just basic for loop introduction, it does look a lot cleaner than the while loop solution from last section.

Excercise: Modify the temp conversion program to print the table in reverse order. (From 300 to 0)
    - I can just  initialize fahr as 300 then step negative 20 degress each iteration until we hit the stopping point of 0
