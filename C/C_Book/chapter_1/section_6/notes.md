Chapter 1 Section 6: Arrays
===
Like most lang's array subscripts start at 0, but array's in C need
explicit size declartions or an initiliazer. Other than that array's 
in C are pretty normal, so going to skip over most of this section.

Write a program to count digits, white space, & others
---
Take in user input with `getchar()` and run logic to count occurances of digits with an array where the index 0 is for digit 0 ... and index 9 is for digit 9 and the value is the number of occurances.
The book also counts white space and other chars.
