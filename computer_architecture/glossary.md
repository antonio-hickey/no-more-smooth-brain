Glossary of some terms & definitions
---

* `Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)`: An architecture where a single instruction can execute many low-level operations, or are capable of multi-step operations, or addressing modes within single instructions.

* `Addressing Modes`: specifing how to calculate the effective memory address of an operand by using information held in registers and/or constants contained within a machine instruction or elsewhere.

* `Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)`: An architecture where each instruction performs only one function (ex: copy a value from memory to a register).

* `Condition Code`: extra bits kept by a processor that summarize the results of an operation and that affect the execution of later instructions.

* `Compare & Branch`: looking at flags set by previous instructions (ex: "carry happened" or "result was 1") to decide whether to branch out.
