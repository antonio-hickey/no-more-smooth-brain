Binary Search Algorithm
===

A search algorithm, where you start in the middle of the search space and compare it to the element being searched for. 

Based on the middle element being higher or lower than the element being searched for you divide the search space in half. Repeating this until the middle element is the element being searched for, or the element is not in the search space.

Time Complexity
---
Binary search runs in logarithmic time ( `O(log n)` ) in the worst case.

Application
---
Binary search is for **ORDERED** arrays, unless the array is small.
