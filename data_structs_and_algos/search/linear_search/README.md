Linear Search Algorithm
===

A simple search algorithm, it just checks each and every element in search space one by one. If the current element being checked is the element being searched for 
it terminates returning the element's index, or if it doesn't find the element being searched for after checking every element it terminates returning null.

Time Complexity
---
Linear search runs in linear time ( `O(n)` ) in the **worst** case. Making at most `n` comparisons (where `n` is the number of elements in search space).

Application
---
Linear search is practical when you need to search a unordered list or a list with **ONLY** a few elements.
