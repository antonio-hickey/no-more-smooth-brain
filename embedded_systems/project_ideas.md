InfraRed Tempature Sensor
---
Tempature sensor for perfectly temping my derrrrrbs (iykyk) anyways in a nutshell: a system to read/display tempature, and then alert me when the tempature is at a desired point. 

In able to do this I will need:
---
* Infrared sensor (MLX90614) to read tempature of a object in it's aim.
* Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to read how far the object is from the Infrared sensor (for more accurate temp reading).
* Display board to display the current tempature of the object.
* Buzzer (EK2146) to alert at a desired tempature reading.
* Breadboard to connect everything together.
* 7-12 V DC Battery
* Jumper Wires






Embedded Automobile Engine Locking System, Using GSM Technology

Set a password to turn on the car engine, if the driver takes more than 3 attempts, then
the engine is locked and an SMS message is sent to alert me.
