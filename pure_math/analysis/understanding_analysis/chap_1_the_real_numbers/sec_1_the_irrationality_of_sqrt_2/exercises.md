Excercise 1.2.1
---
* (a) Prove $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. Does a similar argument work to show $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational?
  -  Proof: A rational number is any number that can be expressed as $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and are in simplest form (no common factors). Let's start by assuming there IS a rational number whose square is 3 and then we can continue on a logical path until we reach a unacceptable conclusion.
    - (1) $$\sqrt{3} = p/q$$
    - (2) Square both sides of the equation: $$3 = \frac{p}{q}^2$$
    - (3) From this(2) and a little algebra we can see $3q^2 = p^2$. This implies $p^2$ is a multiple of 3. Now we must consider $p^2$ is divisible by 3, but here we can no longer logically proceed as $p$ and $q$ were already assumed to have no common divisor.
  
  - Does a similar argument work to show $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational? (yes)

* (b) Where does the prooof of Thereom 1.1.1 break down if we try to use it to prove $\sqrt{4} \in \mathbb{Q}$?
  - (1) $$\sqrt{4} = p/q$$
  - (2) Square both sides of the equation: $$4 = \frac{p}{q}^2$$
  - (3) From this(2) and a little algebra we can see $4q^2 = p^2$, but now if 4 divides $p^2$, $p$ must be even, so $p = 2r$ for some integer r. For this reason $$q^2 = r^2$$ which implies $r = \pm{q}$, therefore $p = \pm{2q}$.
  - (4) This may seem like a contradiction at first glance due to $p$ and $q$ sharing factors of $q$, but when $q = \pm{1}$ there are no common divisors.
